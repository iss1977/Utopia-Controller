## Features

- Measure time ( it's 2100 AD) and stop it on request.
- Store, recall events from a central storage (Global Stacker)
- Run events based on citizen needs
- Test platform for co-developers
- Extended to a simple Web Server application :  https://github.com/iss1977/MyUtopiaWithWebserver.git

 

```sh
To run the application use JAVA 8 or above.
```

> Note: many thanks to my `Dear Collegues` for writing those nice events and tasks for our Utopia citizens and trusted me to write the time mashine :-)
